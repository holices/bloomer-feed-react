Project developed with the aim of practicing the knowledge acquired about react, more specifically about COMPONENTS. It's a basic project that simulates a timeline similar to traditional social networks, which includes a post and allows other users to interact with it, with comments and likes (NO LIMITS ON LIKE PER USER).
